  <h1>Who is Jean-François Champollion?</h1>
  <h2>Champollion is the decipherer of the Egyptian hyroglyphs, the written language of ancient Egypt. This is his story.</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>In 1798 Napoleon invaded Egypt and a French soldier working on reinforcing a French fort dug into the ground and inadvertently discovered what we now call the Rosetta Stone.</li>
        <li>The Rosetta Stone is a slab of basalt that contains text written out in three different scripts- Egyptian hieroglyphs on top, Demotic in the middle (the script of the common people of ancient Egypt), and ancient Greek on the bottom.</li>
        <li>The French could translate the ancient Greek to discover that this was a proclamation celebrating the reign of Ptolemy V, and at the end of the text it stated the proclamation to be written out in three versions, meaning the content was the same in all three scripts.</li>
        <li>At this point the last known hieroglyphs has been written in A.D. 394 and anyone who could read them had long died off, making this a dead and untranslatable language.</li>
        <li>But now, perhaps, the secrets of the Egyptian hieroglyphs and the content of so many ancient writings could be revealed.</li>
        <li>For years the best and the brightest of Europe tried to crack the code of the hieroglyphs, without luck.</li>
        <li>In 1814 an Englishman named Dr. Thomas Young became a leading figure in the intense race to decipher the language.</li>
        <li>Young had everything on his side: formal education, the blessing of the English establishment (where the stone was in London), what some considered genius, independent wealth, and the devotion of all of his time.</li>
        <li>Young tried mathematical models of all sorts, applying his supposed genius to the problem for years without much fruit, eventually giving up.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in 1802, a young Champollion heard about the Rosetta Stone and told his brother that he would be the one to decipher it.</li>
        <li>At the age of 12 (he was born in 1790 in southern France) he immediately went to work learning everything he could about ancient Egyptian languages and culture.</li>
        <li>He decided he would have to learn the Egyptian language known as Coptic- a mix of Greek and Egyptian that had superseded the ancient Demotic language after Egypt became a Roman colony.</li>
        <li>By this time there were few people remained on Earth who spoke Coptic and Champollion happened upon a monk who gave him a Coptic grammar book, which he studied day and night.</li>
        <li>At one point Champollion wrote to his brother: “I do nothing else. I dream in Coptic… I am so Coptic, that for fun, I translate into Coptic everything that comes into my head.”</li>
        <li>Champollion had none of the resources and luxuries that Dr. Young had, but he had a deep obsession with Egypt and the deciphering of the hieroglyphics.</li>
        <li>Champollion, who spoke dozens of languages and could read many dead languages, understood that languages evolve in a haphazard manner, influenced by the influx of new groups into a society and shaped by the passage of time. They are not mathematical formulas, but living, evolving organisms. They are complex.</li>
        <li>Champollion kept at it, trying new and novel thought experiments on the three texts. Then, in September 1822, a temple had been discovered in an desolate part of Egypt and Champollion got drawings of the hieroglyphs.</li>
        <li>With his new information he could text out several of his working theories in the next text.</li>
        <li>He eventually discovered the translation of Ramses, a pharaoh of the 13th century B.C., meaning the Egyptians had a phonetic alphabet dating back far further than anyone had thought at the time- a truly novel discovery.</li>
        <li>Overwhelmed by what he had found, he ran through the streets of Paris to find his brother. He shouted upon entering the room, “I’ve got it!” and then fainted, falling to the floor.</li>
        <li>After nearly twenty years of a continuous obsession, through endless problems and poverty and setbacks, Champollion had uncovered the key to the hieroglyphs.</li>
        <li>He would continue to translate one word after another and figure out that the hieroglyphs were a sophisticated combination of pictograms, ideograms, and a phonetic alphabet, revealing the beautiful writing language of the ancient Egyptians and subsequently revealing the depth and richness of a great society.</li>
        <li>Champollion became an instant hero in France and a wealth of knowledge for future generations.</li>
        </ul>
