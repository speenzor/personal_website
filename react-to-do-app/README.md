This is my first true app that can run and do something. I created this app as a way to practice
the creation of a React.js app using Create React App, git, Github, CLI, Javascript, and of course, React.js itself.

I consider this a baby step towards learning React. I followed the instructions from kirupa.com but
typed out all the code myself to better ingrain it. Kirupa did a good job of walking through each step
and describing what each function was doing, how to bind "this", etc. Although this walk-through did not use the same kinds of methods and components that I used while learning React with Codecademy.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
This project was also created following the careful instructions from [Kirupa](https://www.kirupa.com/react/simple_todo_app_react.htm).
