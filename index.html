        <h1>My Past</h1>
        <div>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
          Born and raised in southern California. Went to a posh private high school. Went to an unknown private college. Graduated in 2014. Worked six jobs spanning politics, janitorial services, real estate, finance, Uber driver, retail, and freelance.
          <br><br>
          Since graduating from Whitman College in 2014 with a degree in economics I have worked at several diverse jobs. I started out working for a real estate development firm called StoneCreek Company doing due diligence work for several projects, including the acquisition of a retail property that was successfully repositioned to retail and medical office. After I gained valuable knowledge of the real estate industry and developed great attention to detail I desired to move into the financial side of real estate and obtained a position at Lucent Capital, a highly respected commercial real estate mortgage broker in Beverly Hills.
          <br><br>
          In 2016, while working at Lucent Capital, I personally paid for and completed the Investment Banking institute course with investment banker and friend, Chuck Bush, of Great Road Capital. This course takes place over four weekends and it is a significant financial and time commitment that honed my skills in financial modeling, including LBO and merger models.

        <p>
        I read How to Create a Mind, by Ray Kurzweil, which blew my mind and forever altered the course of history. Now an experienced banker building his skills in software creation.
        Learning: JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, React.JS, Bootstrap.
        <br><br>
        I recently leveraged my budding skills in business development and business analysis to join Amerigo Capital in Irvine, as a full-time unpaid intern, in order to gain more relevant experience while looking for the next appropriate opportunity. Amerigo Capital is a new private equity firm and we are close to closing Amerigo’s first-ever deal, selling a boutique, brand-name fragrance company to a strategic acquirer. We are also about to purchase a well positioned specialty pharmaceutical company that will provide us with a strategic platform in the lucrative and growing specialty pharmaceutical industry.
        <br><br>
        At Whitman I was an active member of the Whitman Investment Company, a student-run club that met bi-weekly to discuss and implement investments for a portfolio worth over $700,000. I regularly presented research reports on businesses such as Apple, Tesla, Qualcomm, Wal-Mart, Rio Tinto and others. I was elected CFO and reported quarterly financial results of the portfolio. I successfully recommended the group invest in Apple in 2013 leading to over 80% appreciation in stock value.

        <h1>My Future</h1>
        <p>
        Become a professional software developer before the end of 2018
        <br><br>
        I have developed winning teams through leadership, communication and an intense focus on our goals as the captain of my high school and college cross country teams. As captain of the Whitman College men’s cross country team my co-captain and I lead the team from 7th place in the 2012 Northwest Conference Championship to 3rd place in the 2013 Northwest Conference Championship. We developed a winning team through leadership by example, an intense focus on the team’s goals, hard work, and camaraderie.
        <br><br>
        In 2004 my Mother and I started Lion’s Heart, a national, non-profit community service organization for teens in 6th through 12th grade. Groups elect their own officers, lead their own meetings and decide how to serve the community. There are over 7,000 Members, with over 600,000 hours of community service performed. The organization has grown to over 81 chapters across 17 states. As a member of Lion’s Heart I held several positions within my group, including President, lead my group to many service projects, and was awarded The President’s Volunteer Service Award. Lion’s Heart is now run by my Mother and her amazing team.
        <br><br>
        People who know me best would say that my greatest strength is discipline. Those same people would also say that my other strengths are persistence, attention to detail, focus and results-orientation.
        <br><br>
        I enjoy regularly doing a hard workout at my local CrossFit and reading as much as possible in my free time. I also practice intermittent fasting, making me not only figuratively hungry, but often literally hungry as well.
        <br><br>
        I hope this short bio paints a picture of my drive and desire to succeed and I hope that you consider reaching out to me to talk about how we can help each other achieve our respective goals.
