          I was born and raised in beautiful southern California. In 2005 I was admitted to the highly selective and prestigious St. Margaret’s Episcopal School for the 8th grade and high school. After graduating from St. Margaret’s I attended the well-known and also very prestigious Whitman College in Walla Walla, WA to study economics and business. There I learned the inner workings of economics and accounting that would form the foundation of my knowledge later in life. At Whitman I was also a highly successful cross country and track athlete, leading my team from 7th place in the conference in 2012 to 3rd place in 2013. My time as a student-athlete honed my skills in leadership, teamwork, and communication. In 2014 I graduated and was off into the real world to continue building valuable skills.
          <br><br>
          After graduation I worked a wide array of jobs to build skills in many different fields. I worked at a call center, worked at a running shoe store, drove for Uber, worked at a cleaning company, worked for a real estate developer, went door to door for a presidential campaign, worked at a commercial real estate mortgage broker, and worked an unpaid internship at a private equity firm. I currently work at a community bank underwriting and originating business loans and relationships.

        <h1>My Present</h1>
        <p>
        I decided to get into finance after noticing that in the commercial real estate industry you start at the bottom as a broker and then eventually work up to being an equity owner by honing your skills, relationships, and knowledge. As you do your job you become better at your next job.
        <br><br>
        I recently leveraged my budding skills in business development and business analysis to join Amerigo Capital in Irvine, as a full-time unpaid intern, in order to gain more relevant experience while looking for the next appropriate opportunity. Amerigo Capital is a new private equity firm and we are close to closing Amerigo’s first-ever deal, selling a boutique, brand-name fragrance company to a strategic acquirer. We are also about to purchase a well positioned specialty pharmaceutical company that will provide us with a strategic platform in the lucrative and growing specialty pharmaceutical industry.
        <br><br>
        This lead me to think…what is the real estate broker’s equivalent in business? And conclude that banking would be a good way to build relevant skills and see what’s out there.

        <!--
        That’s when I read How to Create a Mind by Ray Kurzweil. This book goes into the technical details of how the human brain works and how mankind will mimic it through computers to create artificial intelligence. The author provides the roadmap for the development and capabilities of artificial intelligence in the near and far future. This book absolutely changed the way I see the world and sparked my interest in software and caused me to begin learning to code.

        What skills have I built since graduating college and working a myriad of jobs? Discipline, persistence, frugality, focus, goal-orientation, attention to detail, strict fasting and dieting, how to learn quickly, communication. I practice these skills by fasting and dieting, running, reading a ton, networking, writing.
        <br><br>
        I like to contribute my energy to small, non-bureaucratic teams that will allow me to work with a variety of people and challenges, and learn quickly.
