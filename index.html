  <h1>Welcome to Spencer's Website</h1>
  <h3>Entirely created by Spencer Corwin</h3>
  <p>I am an outgoing, motivated, and results-driven financier looking to provide a relationship-based banking experience for my clients in seniors housing, specialty finance, owner-occupied real estate, and other industries. We specialize in loan products ranging in size from around $1 million to $20 million, and as a smaller bank we can tailor our products to your unique circumstances.
In my free-time I like to read, workout, meet new people, and spend time with friends and family. I am always meeting and connecting with new people from a wide variety of interesting and disparate fields. I am a deeply curious person and am always learning.
I look forward to connecting with you to determine how I can help you accomplish your goals.</p>
