            In 2014 I graduated from Whitman College with a degree in economics and was off into the real world to continue to build valuable skills.

              After graduation I worked a wide array of jobs in many different fields. I worked at a call center, worked at a running shoe store, drove for Uber, worked at a cleaning company, worked for a real estate developer, went door to door for a presidential campaign, worked at a commercial real estate mortgage broker, and worked at a private equity firm. I currently underwrite and originate business loans, and maintain customer relations at a local bank.

            <p>
              As I worked these jobs I never felt that I had quite found my place, but I knew that if I made learning my priority that I would pick up valuable skills and knowledge wherever I worked. This played out very well as I sharpened many skills over this chaotic period. Discipline, persistence, frugality, focus, goal-orientation, attention to detail, perceptiveness, and communication are some of the main skills I built. I continue to practice these skills daily by fasting and dieting, running, reading, networking, writing, communicating, and managing people and projects.

              After seven jobs I made a conscious and directed decision to pursue work in banking. My objective in working in banking was to build valuable skills that could be applied widely, while simultaneously being in a position where I would be exposed to many different businesses and industries. I figured that banking would be a great way to build relevant skills in accounting, communication, and business, as well as to see what industries existed that could peak my interest.

            It was in late 2017 that I then read How to Create a Mind by Ray Kurzweil and had my interest sufficiently peaked. Kurzweil goes into the technical details of how the human brain works and how computer software can be used to create artificial intelligence. Reading this book made me realize the absolutely world-changing and still largely-untapped potential for software. It was right then that I decided I had to learn how to code and commit myself 100% to this field.
