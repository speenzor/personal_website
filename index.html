            In 2014 I graduated from Whitman College with a degree in economics and was off into the real world to continue to build valuable skills.

              After graduation I worked a wide array of jobs in many different fields. I worked at a call center, worked at a running shoe store, drove for Uber, worked at a cleaning company, worked for a real estate developer, went door to door for a presidential campaign, worked at a commercial real estate mortgage broker, and worked at a private equity firm. I currently underwrite and originate business loans, and maintain customer relations at a local bank.

              After seven jobs I made a conscious decision to pursue work in banking. Banking is an amazing industry with incredible opportunities for personal growth and expansion, and is a great way to serve businesses with a very valuable service. I truly enjoy working with businesses to help them pursue their goals and serve their customers. I strive to become a valuable advisor to our clients by reading and by talking to other people in many different industries.
